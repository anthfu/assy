Example project to mess around with [x86-64 assembly](https://www.nayuki.io/page/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming) on an Intel Mac.

Note the differences in entry point, directives, linker flags, and exit system call compared to the typical examples for Linux. See Apple's [OS X Assembler Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/Assembler/000-Introduction/introduction.html) for details.
